# WordGriddle.com
Homepage for the upcoming WordGriddle game.

## Rationale
- The URL exists, so it needs some content
- The game is in development, and we'll need somewhere to showcase it
- When the time is right, we will drop the game right here

## Guidance for the UI
> I would like a new, responsive web page. In landscape mode, the left hand side of the display is given over to a 4x4 grid of letters. Above and Below the grid will be areas where I can add controls (buttons and checkboxes) and messages (status reports). On the right of the screen will be large display of text consisting of h3 titles and columnar lists of words. The right hand side area needs to support scrolling if there is sufficient content, with the left hand side staying fixed and in view. In Portrait mode, the two portions of the screen should be changed so that the grid and controls are at the top of the display and the other content beneath. The page has a navbar at the top and an H1 title above the content described above  




# Thoughts / To-Do
- Setting dialog, accessible from top-right
  - Dark/Light Mode
  - Puzzle Font?
  - ?

- Choose a level, where
  - easier levels bring:
    - grey numbers
    - red numbers
    - word counts at lengths
    - ...
  - rewards come in after a while anyway?

- restart puzzle button
  - (enabled only when there are saved results, once we can save results) 

- Put together a complete puzzle with solution
- Store progress and have 'reset progress' to clear that
  - Test with F5 Refresh etc.
- Show found words, word totals/countdowns
- Show red/grey numbers (optional)
